### General Evaluation

**1. Work Environment**  
Dynamic and positive working environment. Members are always ready to help and share new knowledge with each other for mutual development. The workspace is neat and comfortable; the atmosphere is very professional yet also very comfortable, helping to increase work efficiency.

**2. Support from mentor / team admin**  
The mentor provided very detailed guidance, explained clearly when I didn't understand, and always encouraged me to ask questions. The team admin supported procedures and documents, creating conditions for me to work favorably.

**3. Relevance between work and major**  
The work I was assigned matched the knowledge I learned at school, while also expanding into new areas that I had never approached before. Thanks to this, I was able to implement projects that I had cherished for a long time but was still struggling with where to start. Besides that, I both consolidated my foundational knowledge and learned additional practical skills. Working at the company was truly a stroke of luck.

**4. Learning opportunities & skill development**  
During the internship, I learned many new skills such as approaching and using new technologies, using project management tools, working processes in a more professional manner, and also professional communication in a corporate environment. The mentor also shared a lot of practical experience helping me orient my career better.

**5. Culture & Team Spirit**  
The company culture is very positive: everyone interacts and supports each other, working seriously but still having fun. However, there were still a few peers with bad attitudes, lacking the spirit of actively learning new knowledge, not performing assigned tasks well, and having an unserious attitude towards the assigned project.

**6. Policies / Benefits for interns**  
The company organizes events and workshops to share experience about new knowledge, which is a very wonderful thing.
